## Steps to Reproduce
What I did to get here?
- Create Trello Board listing tasks to completion
- Created modules with functions to acquire and clean the data
- Examined the data and came up with 4 questions
- Created visualizations relating to the quesitons
- Ran statistical tests to answer the questions
- Created a baseline model to test baseline accuracy
- Created numerous models to see how various algorithms performed
- Modified algorithms to see how changes affected performance
- Chose the 4 that performed the best and evaluated them on the validate training set
- Best performing model evaluated against test
- Decided on a recommendation and next steps

## The Plan

### Wrangle
- wrangle.py
Functions to acquire, clean, tidy, prepare, split, and scale the data for use.

### Explore
#### Ask Questions
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

#### Visualizations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn used to create visualizations
#### Statistical Tests
Used .mean(), t-test, and pearsonr to answer statistical questions
#### Summary
Wrap up all of the testing conclusions

### Clustering


### Modeling
#### Select Evaluation Metric

#### Evaluate Baseline

#### Develop 3 Models

#### Evaluate on Train
All models evaluated on train, but top 4 were validated
#### Evaluate on Validate
Ensure no overfitting takes place
#### Evaluate top model on Test
Top model evaluated against test dataset to see how it performed on unknown data.
